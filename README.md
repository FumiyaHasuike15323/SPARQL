# SPARQL Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing SPARQL query generation performance using BLEU scores. Each script is designed to address specific aspects of the analysis, such as evaluating the impact of query components or extracting key statistics.

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `github_scraping.py`

This script interacts with the tebaqa system by sending natural language questions and retrieving the corresponding SPARQL queries generated by the system. It uses Selenium for browser automation to facilitate this interaction.

**Key Features:**

- Input: JSON file with corrected questions.
- Sends the questions to the tebaqa system.
- Retrieves and saves the predicted SPARQL queries to a CSV file for further analysis.

### 2. `github_question_word.py`

This script analyzes the BLEU scores based on the first word ("Question Word") in the natural language questions.

**Key Features:**

- Filters question words like "what," "where," "who," etc.
- Calculates the average and median BLEU scores for each question word.
- Outputs the statistics to a CSV file.

### 3. `github_select_or_ask.py`

This script evaluates BLEU scores based on the type of SPARQL query, specifically whether the query is of type `SELECT` or `ASK`.

**Key Features:**

- Extracts the first word of the SPARQL `Ground Truth Query` to determine the query type.
- Calculates BLEU score statistics for `SELECT` and `ASK` queries.
- Saves the results to a CSV file.

### 4. `github_bracket.py`

This script investigates the impact of the number of `<>` brackets in SPARQL queries on BLEU scores.

**Key Features:**

- Counts occurrences of `<>` in the `Ground Truth Query`.
- Groups BLEU scores by the count of `<>` brackets.
- Outputs statistics such as average BLEU score, median BLEU score, and question count to a CSV file.

### 5. `github_test.py`

This script calculates the BLEU score and Exact Match between the predicted SPARQL queries and the ground truth queries. It serves as a utility to validate and analyze the accuracy of SPARQL query generation.

**Key Features:**

- Compares predicted SPARQL queries with ground truth queries.
- Computes BLEU scores to evaluate the closeness of the predicted queries to the ground truth.
- Calculates the Exact Match score to identify identical matches.
- Provides debugging and verification support for the analysis process.
